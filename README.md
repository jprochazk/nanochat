# nanochat

Twitch chat client written in Rust.

```
$ RUST_LOG=info cargo run
```

## Is it any good?

Not right now! If you want something cross-platform and easy to use, [Chatterino](https://chatterino.com/) is a great option.

My plans for this app are:
- Customizable (themes, layouts)
- Low resource usage
- Fast startup
- Intuitive, clean interface
- Command palette + customizable keybinds
